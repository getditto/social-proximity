 Stops fetching the fetcher's associated attachment and cleans up any associated resources.

 Note that you are not required to call `stop` once your attachment fetch operation has finished.
 The method primarily exists to allow you to cancel an attachment fetch request while it is ongoing
 if you no longer wish for the attachment to be made available locally to the device.

 Niling out any reference(s) you have to the attachment fetcher will also lead to the attachment
 fetch operation being stopped.
