/**
 A representation of a `DITDocument` that provices access to an update API through a subscripting
 API that specifies the key in the document to be updated.

 A `DITMutableDocument` object is used as part of update operations for a document. It provides
 access to updating a document through a subscript-based API. A subscript operation returns a
 `DITMutableDocumentPath` that you can then use to chain further subscript operations to in order to
 access nested values in a document. Once you've defined the path to a key in a document that you'd
 like to update, by using subscripts, then you can use the functionality defined on
 `DITMutableDocumentPath` to perform the desired document update(s).

 Note that objects of this type should only be used within the scope of the update closure that they
 are provided in.
