 A representation of the events that can occur in relation to an attachment fetch.

 There are three different attachment fetch events: `Completed`, `Progress`, or `Deleted`.

 There will be at most one `Completed` or `Deleted` event per attachment fetch. There can be many
 `Progress` events delivered for each attachment fetch.

 Updates relating to an attachment fetch are delivered by registering a `DITAttachmentFetcher`
 through a call to `fetchAttachment` on a `DITCollection` instance.
