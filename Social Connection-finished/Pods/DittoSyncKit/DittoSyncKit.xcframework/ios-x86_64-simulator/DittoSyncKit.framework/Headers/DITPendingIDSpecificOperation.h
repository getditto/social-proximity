/**
 These objects are returned when using `findByID` functionality on `DITCollection`s.

 You can either call `exec` on the  object to get an immediate return value, or you can establish
 either a live query or a subscription, which both work over time.

 A live query, established by calling `observe`, will notify you every time there's an update to the
 document with the ID you provided in the preceding `findByID` call.

 A subscription, established by calling `subscribe`, will act as a signal to other peers that you
 would like to receive updates from them about the document with the ID you provided in the
 preceding `findByID` call.

 Calling `observe` will generate both a subscription and a live query at the same time.

 If you'd like to only observe local changes then you can call `observeLocal`.

 If you want to observe changes in such a way that you can signal when you're ready for the live
 query to deliver a new update then you can call `observeWithNextSignal` or
 `observeLocalWithNextSignal`.

 Update and remove functionality is also exposed through this object.
