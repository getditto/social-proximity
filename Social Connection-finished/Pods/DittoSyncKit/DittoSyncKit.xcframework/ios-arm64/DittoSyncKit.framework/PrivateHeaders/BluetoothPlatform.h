// REFACTORING NOTE: In future this class should be split into two platforms registered independently, the same as
// AWDL Client and AWDL Server. This split has already been done at the transport level. They are completely
// different classes with different connection patterns and it will be much more maintainable if they're not both
// in the same file.

/// Implements iOS-specific Bluetooth functionality. It is assumed there is only one instance.
